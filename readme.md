  This is to practice use of handlebars and sql:
  
  * Using Express, MySQL, Handlebars, and the starter code as a jumping-off point, you will be creating a simple web application which allows users to create, read, update, and delete popular quotes.

  * Your application will have two pages:

    * One will show all of the quotes within a database and will allow users to create a new quote or delete an existing one. A button next to each, labeled "Update This Quote," will take users to the other page which shows the quote selected and will allow them to update it with new information.

  *** after testing the app, password was removed from the connection information for privacy and security purposes.
